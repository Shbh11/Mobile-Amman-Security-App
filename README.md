# Mobile-Amman-Security-App
This Python appliation provides the UI for a proof-of-concept that was presented to the Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC) Cybersecurity Solutions Contest, for a mobile application that warns users of cyberattacks on their mobile devices.

### Proposed Soultion
----
Users have to download and install the DESC application on their phones/tablets. They need to provide important details like name,phone number and create a username and password. (For added security users may use fingerprint scanning if supported by device to login)

#### Implementation:

*The main feature of this app is the ability to detect if your phone has been hacked and then give you additional information on which type of hacking method may have been used such as wifi -hacking,app with malicious code etc.*

*Depending upon what type of hack has been employed , the app can prompt you to take some action such as uninstalling malicious apps, changing passwords etc.*

*However to add more security, users can login to the DESC Security Portal (from a different device,PC, not the hacked device) using their username and password they used for the app and then through the portal they can block their phone number so that the hacker is unable to use it for illegal or unauthorized purposes.The reason for having a security portal and logging from another device is to make it more secure rather than using the hacked device.*

*In worst case scenarios, users can directly report to DESC using the portal who can help the person to re-secure his/her device and take legal action.*
